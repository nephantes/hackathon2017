#Code of Conduct

We value the participation of each member of our community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, presenters and attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, religious or ethnic identity, national origin, physical appearance, body size, or ability. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the event organizers.

Please show respect for all attendees. In particular:

Offensive behavior such as verbal abuse, intimidation, or harassment will not be tolerated.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue (including mailing lists) or talk. Also, be sure to turn off or change any inappropriate ring tones, desktop backgrounds, or screen savers.
Remember that all our attendees are here for similar reasons, and do not make assumptions about anyone's interests, skill level, or profession based on their appearance or background.
Remember that "no means no." If someone asks you to stop speaking about a particular subject, or to leave them alone, please do so immediately.
Support your friends and colleagues. If you see someone behaving badly, please let them know that you're not OK with it.
If you are giving a presentation or talking to a group, anything beyond the occasional mild curse word is not appropriate.
While criticism of software, programming practices, etc. is OK, please try to offer constructive improvements or alternatives. Personal criticism and ad hominem attacks are never OK.
